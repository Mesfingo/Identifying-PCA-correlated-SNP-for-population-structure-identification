# Function arguments:
1. gdata :- the genotype data with the genotypes coded as {-1, 0, 1}. It is recommended that missing genotypes be imputed. 
            The imputation in an other repository in this accoung may be used for that purpose. 

pop1_svd <- svd(pop1)

# for all of the right singular vectors, square and then sum over two columns (assuming two principal comonents)
p <- rowSums((pop1_svd$v[, c(1), drop = F] ) ^ 2)

# get order of the columns (SNP) of genotype matrix based on ordering of the value 'p'
colnames(pop1[, c(order(p, decreasing = T))])[1:10]

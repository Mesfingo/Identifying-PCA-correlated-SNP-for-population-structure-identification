# Function arguments:
1. gdata :- the genotype data (individual x SNP) with the genotypes coded as {-1, 0, 1}. The SNP columns should be named.
            Missing genotypes should be imputed. The imputation function in an other repository in this accoung (R-code-for
            -missing-genotype-imputation) may be used for that purpose. The genotype data should only be composed 
            of columns with genotype data (no individual ID, or other info)
2. tp :-    Intiger for the number of principal components to use. 
3. ts :-    Intiger for the number of top snp to return.      

function(gdata, tp, ts){

# apply standardization
gdata2 <- apply(gdata, 2, function(x){(x-mean(x))/sd(x)})

# perform SVD
gdata_svd <- svd(gdata)

# for all of the right singular vectors calculate 'p' by squaring and then summing over 'tp' columns
p <- rowSums((gdata_svd$v[, c(1:tp), drop = F] ) ^ 2)

# get names of top 'ts' SNP of the genotype matrix based on ordering of the value 'p'
return(colnames(gdata[, c(order(p, decreasing = T))])[1:ts])
}

# I will include an example with simulated data soon.
